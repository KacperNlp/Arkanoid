# Arkanoid
The last game created as a task from course on Udemy of JS OPP and it's also first attempt for this game.

## About this project
I created 4 levels with different difficulty (at ever highest levels I used blocks with more hp, thanks that player has to hit this blocks two times). I used two types of block in this project, this types/kinds of blocks are gray(with 1hp) and red(with 2hp). Player can also pause the game or resume when he press P on keyboard (keyCode = 80), to move left or right player has to press left(move left) and right(move right) arrows.
